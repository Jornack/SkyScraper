# Project: SkyScraper - NeuroSky Log & Graph utility 

[Overview]
SkyScraper was inspired by ericblue's Mindstream and brain_grapher (https://github.com/ericblue).
Brain_grapher provided me the graphs, but couldn't log. Mindstream could log, but didn't show any graphs. So, basically I just combined the 
functionality of both applications. 

I originally developed and tested this application with the Mindwave and Thinkgear 2.2.0.0, java version "1.6.0_26". I assume it works for the MindSet as well, but 
I don't own a MindSet so I'm not sure. Let me know if it does or does not :)
