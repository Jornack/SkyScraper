# Project: SkyScraper - NeuroSky Log & Graph utility 

[Overview]
SkyScraper was inspired by ericblue's Mindstream and brain_grapher (https://github.com/ericblue).
Brain_grapher provided me the graphs, but couldn't log. Mindstream could log, but didn't show any graphs. So, basically I just combined the functionality of both applications. 

I originally developed and tested this application with the MindWave and Thinkgear 2.2.0.0, java version "1.6.0_26" in Win7x64 Ultimate. I assume it works for the MindSet as well, but I don't own a MindSet so I'm not sure. Let me know if it does or does not :)

[Features]

[Installation]
Just run :
Java -Djava.ext.dirs=lib -jar dist/skyscraper.jar

[Issues]
The Disconnect button doesn't switch back to Connect when the connection is terminated by Thinkgear (i.e. ThinkGear crashes)

[ToDo]
- Add statistics tab
- Add replay of saved session
- Add preload of saved session before generation so user can select specific parts of the session to generate.
- Add option to skip the savedialog and start saving immediately
- Make fancy Signal indicator
- Add fancy icon [Done]
